# The-Floor-is-Lava (Little Omega Engine)

A work-in-progress fps engine. The name is because one idea for the game involved being on an alien planet with lava.
Inspired by [Marathon](https://alephone.lhowon.org).

### About the Engine

This is written in Lua using the [Love2d](https://love2d.org) engine. I chose it because I like using Lua; I have some experience with [Pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) and [Playdate](https://play.date) programming, both of which use Lua.

### To Run

Download [Love2d](https://love2d.org) and this game. Drop the folder containing `main.lua` and `editor.lua` onto the Love2d application. Use keys `r` and `e` to switch between editor and game modes. You cannot really save what you make in the editor, so don't make anything super awesome.
